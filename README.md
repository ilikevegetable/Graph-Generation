# Graph-Generation

Topic: **Graph generation and its application in pharmacy**

1. Problem: given a set of graphs, design a property model for learning the graph distribution, and generate a new graph with some particular property (depends on the downstream task).
2. Advantage: real-world dataset in the pharmacy domain 
3. Position: 2-3 people
